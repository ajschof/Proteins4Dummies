# Proteins4Dummies (P4D)
Exploring ML with protein structures.

## Introduction
The introduction of protein prediction models such as DeepMind's AlphaFold system inspired the making of this repo. I want to be able to understand how it works and how I could possibly replicate it using similar techniques on a smaller scale.

## Background

Proteins are complex. They are responsible for a large variety of biological processes, the most important being catalysis, signalling and structural support. Harnessing the ability to predict their three-dimensional structures at will, and then being able to determine their properties would be revolutionary (especially if this technology was available on a wider scale).

Experimental methods have been used for years to determine protein structures. They take forever, are expensive, and exhausting. The dawn of artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms promises efficient and reliable prediction models that can replace these conventional, practical methods of finding protein structures.

## Goals

1. Research and understand the foundations of creating a model similar to AlphaFold

2. Develop a custom protein prediction model by implementing deep learning algorithms and attention mechanisms

3. Contribute to the community with my understanding )even if it is very little)
